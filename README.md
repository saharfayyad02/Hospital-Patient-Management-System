# Hospital Patient Management System

This program implements a Hospital Patient Management System using an AVL tree to store patient data and a hash table for efficient data retrieval. The system allows for operations such as adding new patients, updating patient information, listing patients, searching for patients by illness, deleting patients, and saving/loading data from files.

## Implementation Details
The program consists of two main components:
1. AVL Tree Implementation: Handles patient data using an AVL tree data structure.
2. Hash Table Implementation: Uses patient data to create a hash table for efficient data retrieval.

### AVL Tree Operations
- Read data from the "patients.txt" file and load it into the AVL tree.
- Insert a new patient along with their information.
- Find and update information for a specific patient.
- List all patients in lexicographic order.
- List all patients with the same illness.
- Delete a patient from the system.
- Save AVL tree data to the "patients_hash.data" file.

### Hash Table Operations
- Print the entire hash table including empty spots.
- Print the size of the hash table.
- Print the used hash function.
- Insert a new patient record into the hash table.
- Search for a specific patient in the hash table.
- Delete a specific patient record from the hash table.
- Save the hash table back to the file.

## Usage
1. Compile the program.
2. Run the executable.
3. Follow the on-screen prompts to perform operations such as adding, updating, listing, searching, and deleting patient records.
4. Data will be saved automatically to files when necessary.
